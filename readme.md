This is the initial repo for my Dev Lab
This repo is for testing/experimenting with different technologies, it will contain several subfolders for each of the sub projects that are being tested.
This will also contain branches in GIT one for each type of project, experiment or test. The branch will be documented in the readme file at the root directory describing what the branch is about, what technologies were tested and the lessons learned on each.
